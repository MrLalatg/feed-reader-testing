# Feed reader testing

## Getting started

If you want to run the project just open index.html file with any browser u want.

## Edit the project

If u want to do some changes here's a tip:

* __index.html__ - this is the main html file.
* __js/app.js__ - this is the main js file.
* __css/style.css__ - this is the main css file.
* __jasmine/spec/feedreader.js__ - this is the js file for testing.
